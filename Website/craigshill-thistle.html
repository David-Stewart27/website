						<h2>First Game</h2>
						<p>It is the big day. The game everyone in the team has been talking about. Craigshill Thistle vs Livingston Blue. But this wasn't just any game. As you walk onto the field, you see scouts from both Celtic and Rangers watching from the sidelines. You end up playing the game of your life(so far) and after the game, the manager wants to speak to you. He says "I have had a couple of conversations with the scouts and both Celtic and Rangers want to sign you. Who are you wanting to play for?"</p>
