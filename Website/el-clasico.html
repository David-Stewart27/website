						<h2>Big Decision</h2>
						<p>You have settled in well at your new club and its a big game today. The El Cl√°sico. You are going up against the team who also wanted to sign you so they will be trying their hardest to prove you made the wrong choice. The referee blows his whistle and the match begins. You collect the ball in the middle of the park and from out of nowhere you get fouled and require treatment. The physio doctor gives you the option to get substituted off and get treatment or continue playing with a knock. What do you do?</p>
