						<h2>Big Decision</h2>
						<p>You have been one of the best players of the season and the manager has started you for the last game of the season. You score and assist twice to win the game 4-0 and help with the league and scottish cup double. After the game, the manager asks to see you in his office before you leave. You get in there and tells you to sit down. "we have been given offers from FC Barcelona and Real Madrid FC. They both want to sign you and the money we are talking we just simply cannot refuse. Who would you like to sign for?"</p>
