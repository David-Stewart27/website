						<h2>Big Decision</h2>
						<p>While you were recovering from your injury, your team won the league cup and now you are fit enough just in time to play the game that could win your team the league. It comes to the 60th minute and the manager decides to sub you off. He says "I took you off because I want to make sure you are fit and ready for the big game next week... The Champoins League."</p>
